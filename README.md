**Immersed is a web-based immersive cyber security training platform designed to engage all ages while providing educators / administrators robust controls to tailor training content for any user.** _Immersed is a MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code, I can only provide snippets of my code._ This repository contains React, .NET, and SQL code for the Analytics Dashboard for the System Administrator role.

>This repository contains all the files that I worked on for Immersed.
